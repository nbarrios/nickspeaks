<p>I sit here, thinking of something, something to write down. If only a simple paragraph about the annals of life experience. I keep hitting these keys, these letters looking more and more like weights I never want to move. Suddenly, just now, it hits me. Sometimes, something isn’t all that important. Wrap your head around that sentence. Breathe in and exhale it, let it circulate at the top reaches of consciousness and let it wisp around, toying with something that might be called a spirit. Sometimes, something isn’t all that important. Do you understand yet? Are you still looking for a meaning, a reason why you’re still reading this simple paragraph about the annals of life experience? I sit here, thinking of something, something to write down. And yet, nothing comes. Except for a few words that hint at a truth, but who needs that, right now? Sometimes, something isn’t all that important. And if sometime happens to be now, then something isn’t all that important. Suddenly, just now, it hits me. Sometimes, nothing is important.Some people don’t believe in magic. Some people believe in it so much that they’ve already outlawed it. Some people want to believe in it but are afraid of disappointment. Some people simply ignore it altogether. And finally, some people are reading this sentence. And in that observation lays the truth about magic.Every so often I wish the President and Vice-President would live up to their names, but I’ll leave it to you to imagine what it is that Bush and Dick should go do with themselves.I wish to be writer of short novels and long stories. I wish to imagine worlds that are ten feet wide and people who inhabit universes. I wish to weave words that make you turn the page quickly, back to the pages you’ve already read. And they’ll all start with, I wish.Isn’t it funny how everything relates to life?Nothing worth reading today. Should I have mentioned that at the beginning?Ja.</p>
