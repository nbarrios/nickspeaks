<p>Do we really need a security guard down every aisle at a concert? Is the geriatric crowd at a Bob Dylan concert that great of a concern? Is it some type of cruel joke that THE protest singer of our time plays venues with more rules and precautions than a shooting range? How much money are people making from selling that blurry photo of Bob from 400 feet away?And yes, I'm talking to you, the bald hard-on with a headset and a two-sizes-too-small yellow security shirt: if the 65 year old guy who knows every Dylan lyric, because he was there when they meant something, wants to partake in some recreational cannabonoids, shut the fuck up and hope when you're that age somebody pays you the same deference.</p>
