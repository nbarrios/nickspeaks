<p>I’ve been listening to Loveline for a little less than half my life. I love radio, and despite all you naysayer’s, Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew were a special kind of thing that only happens once in a lifetime. Oh, the rants, the bogus calls (...an asshole the size of a mason jar), the passionate passionate man, lightning rounds, farts, psychic recognition of sexual abuse, germany vs florida, stupid left turn lights, Fletcher from Pennywise going insane and barfing all over the place, and recently, The Darkness walking out because they couldn’t handle the calls. It goes on and on and on. Yes, both Adam and Drew will still be on the radio, but it’ll never be the same.This being the last week:Thanks for the lessons and the laughs. Adam. Drew.Mahalo.</p>
