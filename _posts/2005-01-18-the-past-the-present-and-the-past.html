<p>Yesterdays post was something to cheer me up. These past few weeks have found me writing an abundance of tragic sentences, all of which ended up in stories I can't even bring myself to edit. While my teacher attempted to convince us that factoring polynomials would prove useful (hopefully sometime before we've purchased stone-carved epitaphs), I took a random jumble of memories and took a trip. My happiest moments are always those which are those simplest to create, hardest to remember, and always wickedly unimportant. Do enjoy life, will you? Sometimes the train never stops.I've never had a “woman of my dreams” but if you forced me to choose, it'd be Paz Vega. (I've heard that <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> has an image search)Alias is back. Don't regret missing it for the rest of your life...Okay, the obligatory band news part: After a three week hiatus, things are back to normal, which is to say, rather dull. Dull doesn't mean boring though. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's torture. I'd compare it to a long boring relationship but it would be pure conjecture. Which bring me on to my next point...<em>Don't have long boring relationships until your 30...</em>A simple message brought to you by the National Association for a Sane America (NASA). Also sponsored by the Movement for a Reduced Divorce Rate (MRDR), and the You'll Never Know Before You Try Campaign.If you've been in a long boring relationship and your perfectly happy, I was wondering, can you spare a few Valiums? I'm running low.Yes, being me is as hard as it seems. I'm sure you have a tough time too. Oh, you don't? Try chewing on this. What is it? <em>Molten lava</em>.In an effort to end this post with meaning, a quote by a <em>real</em> writer...<br />
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><em>I don't pretend to know much. Of philosophy I only know what men have known through the eras: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.</em>- Jorge Luis Borges.</p></blockquote>
