<p>So I opened my mouth about something I had planned for my blog and now I'm getting bugged to get started. Well, I will be posting the official announcement this Friday (June 15) with the actual date said feature will start. Things have been delayed severely because my house has no electricity and net access only in the garage, so my computer time is limited to a couple of hours per night, and I have been writing at a measly 1500 words a day or so. I'm almost ready anyways, so check back soon.</p>
