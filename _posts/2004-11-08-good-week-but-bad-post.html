<p>Despite the results last Tuesday, me being down with the Flu, and having three major exams in the same week, I’ve had a good week. I found a few minutes each day to redesign this site. (Now sleek, mean, and so much easier to write for) I played guitar plenty, managed to go to practice twice, and wrote another couple thousand words of a short story I’ve been working on for the better part of the year. I watched two family-friendly movies (Incredibles, Spongebob) that managed something rare for films in the past few years, being both original and brilliant. (“Napoleon Dynamite” was a sad excuse for the existential, angst-ridden “Ghost World” If your &lt;18, steal a copy of the graphic novel, then download a copy of the movie).it’s time for bed. This is the worst post ever, and I apologize. To be continued</p>
