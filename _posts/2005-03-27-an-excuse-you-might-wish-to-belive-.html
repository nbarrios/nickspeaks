<p>Been rather busy with a wide variety of things which, being quite a responsible person, need to be attended to before writing ridiculously  horrible fictions. This is merely an excuse to cover for the following:I've been writing a story for the past three weeks. I'm actually quite angry at it at the moment for the simple reason that it refuses to end. It also likes to rewrite itself every few hours; not because it is imperative to the plot, but rather “because I can.” <em>You</em> might be surprised that a story would literally talk to me. However, I've learned not to worry too much about such things, as it tends to make you decide to jump off elevated surfaces while on lunch break. Especially if you've just been in an argument with an insolent streetlight.When it is done, it will be here; talking to <em>you</em>.Ja.</p>
