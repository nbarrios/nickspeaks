<p>So, I moved my site over to the Movable Type platform. It's a stable, production ready piece of software. They moved from an open source license scheme to commercial licensing a couple of years ago, so I had shied away from it. They do however, provide a free license for non-commercial, single-user sites, so here I am.This is a work in progress, so stuff might change from day to day, but not too much. I'm working on transferring all the old entries over, even though my original Mambo entries are probably lost.Suggestion, as always, are welcome.The calendar was a default, it is now gone.The "thing" above (in the banner) is actually a picture of a neuron, taken with a electron microscope (a rat, I believe by the looks of it, interneuron).</p>
