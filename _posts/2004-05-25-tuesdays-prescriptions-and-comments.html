excerpt: It was a Tuesday when I stopped believing in God. I'd sat on the fence for
  several years, and I took the leap that Tuesday morning. It was never a question
  of incredulity. God was completely plausible. I just though, what difference would
  it make?...

<p>It was a Tuesday when I stopped believing in God. I'd sat on the fence for several years, and I took the leap that Tuesday morning. It was never a question of incredulity. God was completely plausible. I just though, what difference would it make? That morning I realized God only makes a <i>difference</i> if you allow him to.</p>
<p>That <i>difference</i> is a set of restrictions so long that people have been discussing them for the better part of 2000 years. A self-prescribed morality is one that people might follow, or so I care to believe.</p>

<p>Anyways, the point is, the season finale of Joan of Arcadia was fucking awesome. Lately, the show has bordered on cheesy, but has these incredible moments where it simply makes sense. It's not for everybody, and while the show is preachy, the messages are not painfully obvious. (OK, maybe they are, but they don't beat you over the head... too much.) Watch the re-runs this summer. You might be a fan too....</p>
<p>Tommorow I'll rave about Alias.... </p>
<p>You can now leave comments, or questions.....</p>
