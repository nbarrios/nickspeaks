<p>It’s okay to be a pretentious prick sometimes. The trick is knowing when those times are. I don’t. I’m not that good at anything I do. I can play guitar, but I’m not that good. I’m a graphic designer, but I’m not that good. I’m a writer, but I’m not that good. I’m a computer tech guy, but I’m not that good. I use to think it counted that I can do a lot of things, but it doesn’t. It really doesn’t. Nobody cares about <em>not that good</em>. I sure don’t.So, for being a pretentious prick I’m sorry, but if it turns out that that’s all I’m good for, for that, for that, I’m not sorry, not sorry, not sorry at all.Now go be better than me, that’s all I ask.Ja.</p>
