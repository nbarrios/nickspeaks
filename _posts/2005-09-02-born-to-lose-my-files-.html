<p>So today... I mean yesterday, was my birthday. I'm twenty-one years old, and for the first time in twenty-one years, I feel old. Not geriatric, but mature and even, somehow, responsible. Time is running out; I can no longer say “When I grow up I'll...” or “I've still got a few years to figure out...” It's over.But it feels ok, which tells me I might be ready for the start.I managed to spend the day alone. I don't know if it was a choice. Probably not. It was a good day nonetheless. I might be a loser, but I can put several sentences together to explain why it's ok to be one.I tried so hard to have a new short story done for my birthday, but between homework and getting inebriated, I'm short a few pages.On other news, I got a bad surprise Thursday night. My drive decided it was time to quit... which was fine, until I remembered one very important thing. I had all the recent ph7 recordings, and maybe even older stuff. I'm still working on trying to recover a few things, but it probably won't happen. It's sad to see it go, and I'm sorry I didn't back up. Too late.Ja.</p>
