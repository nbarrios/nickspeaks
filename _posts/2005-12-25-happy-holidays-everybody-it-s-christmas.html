<p>Happy holidays everybody! It's Christmas morning: Mr. Lennon is singing about the war being over (but it's never over, is it John?), the tamales are getting heated, and we're getting ready to open our presents. It's a week to the new year! Let's hope we did something good in this one, and concentrate on doing something better in the next.<br />
