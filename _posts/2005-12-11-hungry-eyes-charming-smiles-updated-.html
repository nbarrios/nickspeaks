<p>So, reading over my last few posts, I’ve noticed that this blog has gone downhill. Well, what I mean is that I’ve been whining a lot. I really do want to leave the whining to the rest of you, who do it so well. You’re prolific.Since I’ve already gone so far downhill, I’m just gonna hit rock bottom. A pathetic list should do the trick. To relax after ten hours of studying, a list of ten <em>famous</em> women I find <strong>incredible</strong>. (yes, they all happen to be beautiful, but that’s in keeping with the whole net mentality, isn’t it? Or is that an LA mentality? Anyways, this is meant to be bottom of the barrel stuff.)

<p><strong>Paz Vega</strong><br />Here we begin our study of my psyche. Ms. Vega is all eyes and lips. As we shall see, these are important factors to consider.
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/potente.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Franka Potente</strong><br />Here is another smile. This woman also happens to be a brilliant actress.
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/Chloe_Sevigny.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Chloe Sevigny</strong><br />Eyes. Brilliant actress. Red head.
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/lauren_ambrose1.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Lauren Ambrose</strong><br />Red hair, smile, brilliant actress, and played an artistic nutjob on my favorite show ever, Six Feet Under
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/rachel-mcadams-01.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Rachel McAdams</strong><br />Eyes, smile. She's the girl you wanna bring home to mom.
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/5141.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Shakira Mebarak</strong><br />Before she was shaking her ass on MTV, this woman was known for her masterful heartfelt lyrics. In spanish, her songs are smart, clever, and never outdone. Add to that a beautiful smile, those eyes, and we'll give her a little credit for the belly dancing.
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/fiona69.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Fiona Apple</strong><br />She's got them all beat on the eyes and the talent. She gets bonus points for being the one who doesn't deserve to be put in this stupid list the most. I wish she smiled a bit more, and that when she did, I believed her. It's all my in my head, though.<em>The big three, ladies and gentlemen.</em>
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/brody.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Brody Dale</strong><br />She's scary. She can give Dave Grohl a run for his screaming money. Eyes. Lips. Talent. Oh, and she can kick me ass and I'd let her.
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/kate-winslet-picture-012-800.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Kate Winslet</strong><br />The eyes, the smile, the body. Happens to be in several of my favorite movies. She's not perfect, which makes her, well, perfect. Oh, and she's funny as hell.
<ol />
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/garner42.jpg" /></div>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/garner57.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong><br />The perfect smile in my book. She's Sydney Bristow on Alias. She's a total sweetheart whenever I see her interviewed. She can be badass sexy, or ferris wheel kiss cute. And I'm hoping she didn't choose Ben Affleck for his acting skills.</li>
<p>That was fun. And it turns out my taste is a little weird. (says my cousin) What, no Angelina Jolie? Well, I said incredible. If we went only by looks, it would be a different list.Analysis reveals that there is one Spanish girl. One German girl. One Columbian girl. One English girl. Six American girls. Why are there no Asian women? I'll have to get back to you when I think of one.Leave a comment with your own list. That would totally give us that Livejournal/Xanga experience.(Zooey Deschanel, Hilary Swank, Thora Birch, Scarlet Johansson, Uma Thurman.... only missing because I'm not willing to waste more than a half hour on this. Oh, and I forgot Ms. Knightley, though she belongs more to the hot list than the incredible list.)*Update*:It has been pointed out to me that I made a horrendous omission in the list above.

<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img alt="" src="http://www.nickspeaks.com/10/audrey.jpg" /></div>
<p><strong>Audrey Tautou</strong><br />She reminds me of all the girls I know, which is always a good thing. And her smile...</li>
<p>Add one to the French category.</p>
